### Subtraction of Polynomials using Linked list Theory

 - In the polynomial linked list, the coefficients and exponents of the polynomial are defined as the data node of the list.

 - For subtracting two polynomials that are stored as a linked list. We need to subtract the coefficients of variables with the same power. In a linked list node contains 3 members, coefficient value link to the next node.
