                "a": "The tuple would consist of two zeros",

            "explanations": {
                "a": "Representing the expression like this is logically inaccurate as we lose the information about the coefficient when we assume it is zero.",
                "b": "This is the correct way to represent the desired expression. We do not lose the information about the coefficient and by placing zero in the exponent part we signify that there is no exponent associated with the coefficient.",
                "c": "Although the information about the coefficient will be retained in this option, storing it in the exponent part would mean that it also has an exponent associated with it which is the same as the coefficient value. This would be logically inaccurate.",
                "d": "Not representing an expression because it does not have an exponent would yield in loss of information and thus, wrong result."

                "b": "The operation is not much different. An array element can be thought of as a linked list node."
