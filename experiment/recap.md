### What is Linked list?

A Linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.
### Types of Linked list

  -  Singly Linked list: It contain nodes which have a data part as well as an address part i.e. next, which points to the next node in the sequence of nodes.

  -  Doubly Linked list: In this, each node contains a data part and two addresses, one for the previous node and one for the next node.

  - Circular Linked list: In this, the last node of the list holds the address of the first node hence forming a circular chain.
