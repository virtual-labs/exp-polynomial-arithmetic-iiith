### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this module, we will be learning about :

   - Time and Space Complexity : We will learn about the running time of one iteration to complete the polynomial using linkedlist process.
   - We will learn about stability of polynomials uisng linked list algorithms. Then we will see how polynomials works.
   - Comparison with other algorithms : We will compare polynomials using linked list with other algorithms and see in which situations polynomials is the optimal/not optimal approach to take.
