                "a": "This would be logically inaccurate as terms with different exponents cannot be simply added or subtracted.",
                "b": "This would be logically inaccurate as terms with different exponents cannot be simply added or subtracted.",
                "c": "The terms with the same exponent are then added to ensure that the obtained expression is in its simplified form. This also helps us to preserve space as we would have less number of linked list nodes.",
                "d": "Multiplying the terms with the same exponent will give us a wrong answer. Try to think of the normal multiplication process of polynomials. Sometimes we end up with terms with the same exponents after the multiplication step and we carry out a basic arithmetic operation on them to simplify the expression."
